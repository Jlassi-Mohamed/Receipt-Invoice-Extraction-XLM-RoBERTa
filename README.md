### Project Overview

This repository presents the first approach in our End-of-Year Project, which aims to automate the extraction of entities (such as numbers, dates, products, etc.) from invoices and receipts.

In this approach, we use a traditional NLP method by fine-tuning the **XML-RoBERTa** model on [this dataset](https://github.com/mouadhamri/invoice_dataset). While this method offers high speed and efficiency, it falls short in terms of performance and accuracy due to its lack of awareness of layout and bounding box informationâ€”critical aspects in document understanding.

For comparison, our project also explores two additional approaches:
- Using layout-aware models like **LiLT** and **LayoutLMv3**
- Using **prompt engineering** with generative models such as **Qwen2** and **Qwen2.5-VL**
